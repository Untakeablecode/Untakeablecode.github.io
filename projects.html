        <h3><b>Q:</b> What is this About?</h3>
        
        <p><b>A:</b> Good Question, this site will be for students to see Homework, important dates, and other school related things. The best part of all the owner/admin can take control over this page for their plans without needing to know how to write code.</p>
        
        <h3><b>Q:</b> Will you finish this before school ends?</h3>
        
        <p><b>A:</b> Pfft, no (well, maybe) this really just takes time, even making this simple website just took 25 minutes. If I wanted to make this page <q>pretty</q> triple the time because of course this will have a different interface. If you want to read why this will take a long time or the technical stuff hold your cursor on <abbr title="There is a thing called a database, this place takes your website from being static. Static means not being to do user input, for example sending emails from a form (think of it as the computer only talking to the user). With a database it enables web developers to do that with a combination of other neat things. Making a database is something hard to learn so if you are interested just look online. ;)"><i>me.</i></abbr></p>
